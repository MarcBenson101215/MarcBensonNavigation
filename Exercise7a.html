    Six years after saving the arcade from the Cy-Bugs attack and from Turbo's revenge, 
    the story leaves Litwak's video arcade behind, venturing into the uncharted, expansive and 
    thrilling world of the internet - which may or may not survive Ralph's wrecking. Video game bad 
    guy Ralph and fellow misfit Vanellope von Schweetz must risk it all by traveling to the world wide
    web in search of a replacement part to save Vanellope's video game, Sugar Rush. In way over their heads, 
    Ralph and Vanellope rely on the citizen of the internet - the netizens - to help navigate their way, 
    including a website entrepreneur named Yesss, who is the head algorithm and the heart and soul of 
    trend-making site "BuzzTube."

    One day, David encounters a beautiful pickpocket named Sylvia (Lola Forner, who also appeared in Armor of God) 
    and he is immediately smitten. Meanwhile, inept private dick Moby (Hung) is tracking down the illegitimate daughter of a
    dead count. If the woman can be found within two weeks after his death, his vast riches go to her.

    If not, then her evil stepbrother gets the goods. Of course, Sylvia turns out to be the missing heiress. And naturally 
    her evil step-brother has sent out a bevy of goons to insure his inheritance while David, Moby, and Thomas vow to protect the lass.

    In “Vanguard,” Chan plays Huanting Tang, the boss of Vanguard, an international security firm whose problem-solving skills and 
    ass-kicking abilities are repeatedly conflated with their moral authority. Tang and his employees flex their righteous muscles 
    and try to set a good example for (this past) Lunar New Year by protecting misguided accountant Guoli Qin (Jackson Lou) from 
    the Brotherhood of Vengeance, a Middle Eastern terrorist group that Qin reluctantly helped to fund and therefore arm with weapons
    of mass destruction (“by selling oil and artifacts in Europe”).

    The story of sister and brother, Kate and Teddy Pierce, whose Christmas Eve plan to catch Santa 
    Claus on camera turns into an unexpected journey that most kids could only dream about.
    When they crash, Santa officially introduces himself to the kids, who are surprised at his different 
    than expected appearance.When they get no assistance, they eventually resolve to steal a Dodge Challenger, 
    which itself was already stolen by the bartender, an ex-convict on the "Naughty List Hall of Fame".
    When Claire returns, they go inside to find the living room decorated like their father used to. They start 
    opening presents, including horrendous sweaters from their aunt. Back in the North Pole, Santa is updating his book of True Believers,
    adding Teddy's name to it, when Mrs. Claus (Goldie Hawn) returns with firewood to tell him about hearing about his adventures. 
    When she asks for a movie to watch, Santa takes out the video recording of his adventure that night and winks at the audience.
