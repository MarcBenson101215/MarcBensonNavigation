            Economic and population growth further signal the dire need to invest more in 
modernizing digital infrastructure,which has only been accelerated by the pandemic. 

Speedtest Global Index documents Philippine mobile internet speed at 14.24 Mbps 
(global average 30 Mbps) and fixed broadband speed at 23.80 Mbps (global average 74.64 Mbps).  
For many years, internet speed in the Philippines ranked lower than Syria, and was the slowest
in Asia. Cellular coverage is spotty at best, due to a long lasting duopoly between two major
players that have not encouraged investment in the sector. The nation of 109 million people 
and 7,000 islands only has 20,000 towers. Regulatory change is expected to allow for a third 
player and for common towers, but the vested interests have close relationships with the 
Government in order to craft policies to their advantage. 

Government processes are papercentric, requiring the submission of physical documents even 
after taxes or other paperwork is filed online. That being said, digitization efforts had been
called for and should progress due to the pandemic. However, the Government will need funding
and masterplanning assistance to set standards and implementation procedures for ICT solutions.
The Department of Information and Communication Technology was formed in 2016, but has been 
unable to set nation wide standards or lead on policy issues due to a variety of causes including 
frequent staff turnover. 

Recognizing the challenges and realities above, the Duterte Administration’s goal is to embark on
a digital transformation program to innovate government agencies. Immediate priorities include a
cloud data center, software development for business process improvement, the conversion of local
government units into smart cities, cybersecurity solutions for data privacy protection, and 
improving the internet and mobile services landscape through a national broadband plan.

The Philippines’ growing middle class and the young population are also important drivers of IT 
demand because their spending levels on technology products are on an upward trajectory, benefitting 
premium brands. Infrastructure investments in the Philippines are another source of opportunity. 
The road, railway, airport, bridge, and port systems built will require, at a minimum, design 
software, building information modeling (BIM) for better project management, and file-sharing 
applications. These will drive demand for hardware, software, and services.

The Philippine Government, the business process outsourcing (BPO) industry, the financial sector, 
health, education, and the telecommunications industry are key vertical markets for IT. 
The Philippine Government showed its strong support for the industry by establishing its own 
Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) in 2016. Details on the DICT’s 
projects are listed under “Market Opportunities.”
